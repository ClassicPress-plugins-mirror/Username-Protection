> Remove anonymous access to usernames in ClassicPress to help mitigate brute-force attacks. For visitors who are not logged in, usernames are removed from the REST API, feeds, author pages, and prevented from exposure through other common vectors of discovery.

### Always use the **[latest release](https://github.com/codepotent/username-protection/releases/latest)** on production sites!
